# Suspicious Transactions Analysis FININT Lab

This lab teaches you how to conduct financial intelligence (FININT) analysis. FININT involves gathering and analysing information about financial transactions to identify tax evasion, money laundering or financing of criminal and terrorist organisations.

You will:
- Import a synthetic financial transactions dataset with fields such as amount, sender, receiver, time and jurisdiction.
- Apply rule-based detection logic to flag structuring (smurfing), round-tripping and flows to high-risk jurisdictions.
- Build transaction graphs to visualise money flows and identify hubs and cycles.
- Cross-reference counterparties with public sanctions lists or high-risk entity databases.
- Rank alerts by risk score and document evidence.
- Write a FININT report summarising flagged transactions, analysis and recommended actions.

All data in this lab is synthetic or comes from publicly available sources. No sensitive or classified financial information is used.
